# Teaching Git
I recently ran a workshop on Git for my lab. Notes are for an audience that is on the further end of the SW Carpentry Git-Novice workshop. Focusing more on branching/merging and issues people have run into after toying with a single master branch.

Below are my notes for teaching Git to researchers / basic users.
(Status: work-in-progress)

## Git / Version Control Goals (User Perspectives)
I want to
* Back up my work
* Build off previous work
* Collaborate with teammates on new analyses (branching, merging)
* Re-generate figures 3 years from now (tag it, code never works, )
* Share my code so others can validate my research (although let's be honest, most people hope nobody ever sees their code. This mentality hurts open science)

## Sync changes across computers
Pushing/pulling on a single branch

## What's going on underneath?
Staging areas and distributed version control

## Collaborating on Code

## Tips and Tricks
* stash
* bisect

## Workflows for Teams
